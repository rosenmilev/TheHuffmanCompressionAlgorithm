Entropy in terms of the space,the items contained within the space and the work to be accomplished. The space in data compression corresponds to the resource available. The space in information systems is usually defined in binary and the space available is the bit space. The bit space is usually visualized using a binary tree to describe the possible paths from the root of the tree to the leaves. The paths from the root to a leaves represent the code words required to reach symbols stored in the tree. The combination of all the leaves represents the symbol space as all the symbols must be contained there to maintain the prefix-free property. In information theory and data compression the symbols represent the information contained within the space. The distance between the symbols and a known reference point represents the uncertainty or the entropy within the system. In order to quantify a relationship between these items, it is necessary to put the two terms in proportion. This term k is exhibited in the equation above
